# Implementation of Eight Benchmark Functions in MATLAB and plotting 3-D Map of their 2-D versions
You need to implement the following 8 benchmark functions in MATLAB, for each function also you need to plot 3-D map for 2-D version of that. Please use the “Publish” component in MATLAB after finishing all your implementations and plotting, this component generates a report including your codes also results (i.e., plots) as a PDF file. You need to submit the report which is created by the “Publish” component. Add your group members’ name and student number to the report as a comment. Your design and implementation should be done for the general case, as indicated for the equations; it means dimension of the benchmark problems should be defined as an input parameter; in fact, just for plotting you will call it for D=2. Letter in other assignments we will use them for higher dimensions like D=10 and 30.
